                <h2>How Electric Shock Happens</h2>
                <i class='fas fa-info-circle' style='font-size:36px'></i>
                <p>Electricity flows in closed circuits. A shock occurs when the body becomes part of the circuit. This can happen by:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Touching both wires of an electrical circuit.</li>
                    <li>Touching one wire and ground.</li>
                    <li>Touching a metal object in contact with a live wire.</li>
                </ul>

                    <h4>Injury severity depends on:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The amount of current.</li>
                        <li>The path through the body.</li>
                        <li>The duration of contact.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h4>Other influencing factors:</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Frequency of the current.</li>
                        <li>Heart cycle phase.</li>

     <h2>OSHA Electrical Safety Standard 1926.416(a)(3): Circuit Awareness and Safety</h2> 
     <details>
         <summary>Read More</summary>
         <p>This standard emphasizes the critical importance of knowing the location and condition of electrical circuits at all times. The most effective way to prevent electrical injuries or fatalities is to disconnect power at the source. Employers are responsible for:</p>
         <ul>
             <li>Clearly labeling all circuits with visible signage.</li>
             <li>Alerting workers before they enter areas where live circuits may be present.</li>
             <li>Locating, identifying, and inspecting circuits regularly to maintain safety.</li>
         </ul>
         <h3>8 Key Electrical Safety Tips for Workers</h3>
         <p>Before handling electrical wiring or equipment, workers should be properly trained in safe practices and hazard recognition. These eight tips serve as a guide to reduce risks and prevent accidents.</p>
         <ol>
             <li><h4>Start with a Plan</h4></li>
             <p>Prepare a detailed job plan before starting any electrical work. During this planning stage, assess the environment and equipment to spot hazards. This step ensures that workers use the right PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) and know where to cut the power if needed.</p>
             <li><h4>Wear Appropriate Gear</h4></li>
             <p>Workers must always wear rubber gloves, insulating sleeves, and safety glasses. Fireresistant clothing is recommended to reduce burn risk. During planning, evaluate if more PPE is needed. All metal items like jewelry and watches should be removed before work begins.</p>
             <li><h4>Use the Buddy System</h4></li>
             <p>Never work alone near electrical sources. Having a second person nearby ensures that help can be summoned quickly or CPR can be administered in an emergency. Both team members should be trained in CPR and electrical safety procedures.</p>
             <li><h4>Follow the Lock Out/Tag Out (LOTO) Protocol</h4></li>
             <p>The LOTO procedure helps make sure equipment is de-energized before maintenance begins. Here are the six steps:</p>
             <ol>
                 <li>Inspect the Equipment: Identify any new or missed hazards.</li>
                 <li>Power Down the Circuit: Shut off the electrical supply completely.</li>
                 <li>Isolate the Equipment: Disconnect all electrical sources.</li>
                 <li>Apply Locks and Tags: Lock switches in the “off” position and attach a tag with the workers name and contact info.</li>
                 <li>Discharge Stored Energy: Test and release any remaining power in the system.</li>
                 <li>Verify the System is Safe: Re-check all steps before starting work.</li>
             </ol>
             <li><h4>Avoid Wet or Damp Conditions</h4></li>
             <p>Water conducts electricity and creates a serious hazard. Workers should avoid damp areas or cover them with non-conductive materials, such as wooden boards, if drying isn’t possible.</p>
             <li><h4>Use Ground Fault Circuit Interrupters (GFCIs)</h4></li>
             <p>GFCIs help protect workers by automatically shutting off power if they detect an electrical imbalance, such as during a shock. They serve as a vital backup safety tool.</p>
             <li><h4>Maintain Distance from Overhead Power Lines</h4></li>
             <p>Keep a minimum of 10 feet between workers and overhead power lines, as recommended by OSHA. Awareness is key to avoiding accidental contact.</p>
             <li><h4>Inspect Electrical Equipment</h4></li>
             <p>Check all electrical cords, outlets, and plugs for damage or wear. Replace faulty equipment immediately. For example, plugs missing a ground prong or showing burn marks should not be used.</p>
         </ol>
